## JavaScript Beginners

Placing JavaScript Files in HTML

- Try and place .js files after the body section of an HTML page.
  - As html page loads faster as it does not have to load .js files first.
  - Very often one has to refer HTML page elements usign .js files, so loading .js files before HTML content can lead to errors.
